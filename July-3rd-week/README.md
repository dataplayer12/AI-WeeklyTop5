This week was all about LLAMA 2. Listen to the [clubhouse recording](https://www.clubhouse.com/room/mZ1QDk3e?utm_medium=ch_room_xr&utm_campaign=kg8TmJ4Li51ChJWVy-byMA-826941)

## Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models

[Paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/)

Abstract
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closedsource models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.
